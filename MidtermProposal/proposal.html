	<p> For my midterm project I'd like to explore the strangeness of heightened virtual interactions, and build a site that mimics the zoom interface. For the purpose of this class, I'm going to create a "profile" for each of my classmates as a method to not only learn more about them, but to humanize the classroom experience as well. I'll note intersting comments I remember from specific people, as well as reach out to them and find their social media to further connect with them. Essentially, I'm trying to contextualize the little rectangles we look at twice a week and share my findings with each other, so that at least by the half way point we are more than muted mics. </p>
