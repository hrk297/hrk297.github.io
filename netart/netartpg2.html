      As before, a trolley is hurtling down a track towards five people. You are on a bridge under which it will pass, and you can stop it by putting something very heavy in front of it. As it happens, there is a very fat man next to you â€“ your only way to stop the trolley is to push him over the bridge and onto the track, killing him to save five. Should you proceed? </p>
