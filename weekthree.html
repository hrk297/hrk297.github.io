			<h1> Reflections on Tim Berners-Lee's & Vannevar Bush's Pieces </h1>

			<p> I really enjoyed reading Tim Berners-Lee's thoughts on electronic human rights, as this is a topic I have explored in my own personal research and academic focus. It is exptremely interesting, in my opinion, that access to the internet is essentially a contitutional human right, at least in the western world. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IMo891_X9KWJvgx6D1oGhnLVb38xxqaywsc6rWcc5hI/edit?usp=sharing"> I wrote an essay about technology being a human right, and therefore a prisoner's right </a> in which I explored this concept more thoroughly. In summary, access to technology in this day and age is a direct factor in an individual's position in society, and therefore it is a relfection of their consitutional right of expression (first amendment).  </p>
			<h3> But what happens when we live in a society where even free individuals dont hold their constitutional rights? </h3>
			<p> Where does that leave one in their relationship with technology? Vannevar Bush examined the ways devices work in complex ways that humans don't. (In this case, complex relects the number of steps required to carry out a task, and the extent of interpretation it must be designed to do, whereas humans do not need to consider every facet of an action before commiting it). One of the most facinating places my brain goes when I try to understand the relationship humans have generated with technology, is the fact that it is compltetly unprecedented. No one really knows what spending 16 hours a day staring at a screen will do to the human brain. If we're being honest with ourselves- its impossible to project what will become of humanity as we continue on this course. </p>
